The current state of the project? 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/822fbdba-c7e2-4cd3-b806-0410e3ebf094)

I plan to get rid of the genre selection, so users can freely type songs in as they please and add a drop down as they're typing -
so they can easily find songs if they don't quite remember the full name. 

I also plan to implement the Amazon Cognito register/Login to work better. 

There's going to be more advanced feature selection where users can filter out by ex: tempo, loudness or just key. or three or four of these.

The website will be simple, but it will overhauled as well.
